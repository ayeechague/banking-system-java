Gringotts Bank Modernization (Java OOP Project)

This project reimagines Gringotts Wizarding Bank for the 21st century, built in Java with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

🔮 Features (implemented so far)
Accounts: Wizards and witches can open accounts in galleons, sickles, and knuts.
Transactions: Deposit, withdraw, and transfer money (no dragon required).
Battery-like Balance System: Every spell (transaction) consumes account “energy”.
Admin vs. Client: Admins can create, modify, or delete clients; customers can check balances and request vault access.

✨ Upcoming Magical Features
Random Interest Rates (Potions Version): Like magical potions, interest rates may boost or shrink your savings (between -2% and +5%).
Savings Vaults: Time-limited vaults (30, 60, 90 days) with randomized returns.
Security Trolls (Exceptions Handling): Keep the vaults safe from runtime errors.
Automated Goblin Reports: Generate transaction history automatically.

🛠️ Technologies
Language: Java
Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Concepts: Classes, inheritance, enums, exceptions, and menus

😂 Why Gringotts?
Because if goblins can manage centuries of wizard gold, why not let them test our coding skills? This project is a playful way to practice Java, OOP design, and financial logic while keeping the magic alive.
